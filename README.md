Code Repository of our paper "Data driven multi soliton solutions of the Fokas-Lenells equation using conservation laws in PINN" (https://doi.org/10.1007/s12596-024-01831-z, https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.03105)

-We propose a **conserved density aided neural network** to obtain data-driven multi-soliton solutions of the Fokas–Lenells equation (FLE).

- We incorporate the FLE equation together with its conserved densities into the loss function of a neural network. This leads to a modified Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework that better respects the underlying physics.

## Key Highlights

- We obtain data-driven **bright soliton**, **two-soliton interaction**, and **dark soliton** solutions of the FLE.

Comparative experiments between standard PINN and the modified PINN:
## Improved accuracy of soliton dynamics.
## Lower relative error between predicted and exact solutions.
## Using multiple conserved densities in the loss further enhances accuracy compared to using only one.
